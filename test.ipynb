While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.\\nScraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).\\nAs well as contact scraping, web scraping is used as a component of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation, web mashup, and web data integration.\\nWeb pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include market research, price comparison, content monitoring, and more.  Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data.\\nNewer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers.  For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server.\\nThere are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.\\n\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nAfter the birth of the World Wide Web in 1989, the first web robot,[2] World Wide Web Wanderer, was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.\\nIn December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, JumpStation, was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, Jump Station was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot.\\nIn 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks.\\xa0In 2000, Salesforce and eBay launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public.[3] Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.\\n\\nTechniques[edit]\\nThis section contains instructions or advice. Wikipedia is not a guidebook; please help rewrite such content to be encyclopedic or move it to Wikiversity, Wikibooks, or Wikivoyage. (October 2025)\\nWeb scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions.\\n\\nHuman copy-and-paste[edit]\\nThe simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human\\'s manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.\\n\\nText pattern matching[edit]\\nA simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX grep command or regular expression-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance Perl or Python).\\n\\nHTTP programming[edit]\\nStatic and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using socket programming.\\n\\nHTML parsing[edit]\\nMany websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content, and translates it into a relational form, is called a wrapper. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[4] Moreover, some semi-structured data query languages, such as XQuery and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.\\n\\nDOM parsing[edit]\\nFurther information: Document Object Model\\nBy using a program such as Selenium or Playwright, developers can control a web browser such as Chrome or Firefox wherein they can load, navigate, and retrieve data from websites. This method can be especially useful for scraping data from dynamic sites since a web browser will fully load each page. Once an entire page is loaded, you can access and parse the DOM using an expression language such as XPath.\\n\\nVertical aggregation[edit]\\nThere are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of \"bots\" for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform\\'s robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the Long Tail of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.\\n\\nSemantic annotation recognizing[edit]\\nThe pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[5] are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.\\n\\nComputer vision web-page analysis[edit]\\nThere are efforts using machine learning and computer vision that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[6]\\n\\nAI-powered document understanding[edit]\\nUses advanced AI to interpret and process web page content contextually, extracting relevant information, transforming data, and customizing outputs based on the content\\'s structure and meaning. This method enables more intelligent and flexible data extraction, accommodating complex and dynamic web content[7].\\n\\nLegal issues[edit]\\nThe examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this section, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new section, as appropriate. (October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\\nThe legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the terms of service of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[8]\\n\\nUnited States[edit]\\nIn the United States, website owners can use three major legal claims to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"), and (3) trespass to chattel.[9] However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service that duplication of facts is allowable.\\nU.S. courts have acknowledged that users of \"scrapers\" or \"robots\" may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels,[10][11] which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder\\'s Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder\\'s Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff\\'s possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant\\'s unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[12]\\nOne of the first major tests of screen scraping involved American Airlines (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[13] AA successfully obtained an injunction from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA\\'s website. The airline argued that FareChase\\'s websearch software trespassed on AA\\'s servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[14]\\nSouthwest Airlines has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of \"Computer Fraud and Abuse\" and has led to \"Damage and Loss\" and \"Unauthorized Access\" of Southwest\\'s site. It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site\\'s user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be US Copyright law and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the Supreme Court of the United States, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company Yahoo!, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[15]\\nIn 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in Craigslist v. 3Taps. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).\\nAlthough these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner\\'s system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[16]\\nWhile the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In Cvent Inc. v. Eventbrite Inc. (2010), the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users\\' attention in order for a browsewrap contract or license to be enforceable.[17] In a 2014 case, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,[18] e-commerce site QVC objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly\\'s \\'scraping of QVC\\'s site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly \"excessively crawled\" QVC\\'s retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC\\'s website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC\\'s site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[19] QVC\\'s complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.\\nIn the plaintiff\\'s web site during the period of this trial, the terms of use link are displayed among all the links of the site, at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet. This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below. The court also rejected the plaintiff\\'s argument that the browse-wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of Virginia\\'s adoption of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse-wrap contracting practices.[20]\\nIn Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., a district court ruled in 2012 that Power Ventures could not scrape Facebook pages on behalf of a Facebook user. The case is on appeal, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned.[21][22] In Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc., a court in the US held Meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the Associated Press, but a court in the United Kingdom held in favor of Meltwater.\\nThe Ninth Circuit ruled in 2019 that web scraping did not violate the CFAA in hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which returned the case to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case in light of the 2021 Supreme Court decision in Van Buren v. United States which narrowed the applicability of the CFAA.[23] On this review, the Ninth Circuit upheld their prior decision.[24]\\nInternet Archive collects and distributes a significant number of publicly available web pages without being considered to be in violation of copyright laws.[citation needed]\\n\\nEuropean Union[edit]\\nIn February 2006, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court (Copenhagen) ruled that systematic crawling, indexing, and deep linking by portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk does not conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the European Union.[25]\\nEthical data scraping supports offmarket sourcing in business but must comply with GDPR to avoid privacy violations in automated data collection.[26]\\nIn a February 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction, Ireland\\'s High Court delivered a verdict that illustrates the inchoate state of developing case law. In the case of Ryanair Ltd v Billigfluege.de GmbH, Ireland\\'s High Court ruled Ryanair\\'s \"click-wrap\" agreement to be legally binding. In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, Justice Michael Hanna ruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair\\'s terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.[27] The decision is under appeal in Ireland\\'s Supreme Court.[28]\\nOn April 30, 2020, the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) released new guidelines on web scraping.[29] The CNIL guidelines made it clear that publicly available data is still personal data and cannot be repurposed without the knowledge of the person to whom that data belongs.[30]\\n\\nAustralia[edit]\\nIn Australia, the Spam Act 2003 outlaws some forms of web harvesting, although this only applies to email addresses.[31][32]\\n\\nIndia[edit]\\nLeaving a few cases dealing with IPR infringement, Indian courts have not expressly ruled on the legality of web scraping. However, since all common forms of electronic contracts are enforceable in India, violating the terms of use prohibiting data scraping will be a violation of the contract law. It will also violate the Information Technology Act, 2000, which penalizes unauthorized access to a computer resource or extracting data from a computer resource.\\n\\nMethods to prevent web scraping[edit]\\nThe administrator of a website can use various measures to stop or slow a bot. Some techniques include:\\n\\nBlocking an IP address either manually or based on criteria such as geolocation and DNSRBL. This will also block all browsing from that address.\\nDisabling any web service API that the website\\'s system might expose.\\nBots sometimes declare who they are (using user agent strings) and can be blocked on that basis using robots.txt; \\'googlebot\\' is an example. Other bots make no distinction between themselves and a human using a browser.\\nBots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic.\\nBots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site, like a CAPTCHA. Bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific CAPTCHA patterns or may employ third-party services that utilize human labor to read and respond in real-time to CAPTCHA challenges. They can be triggered because the bot is: 1) making too many requests in a short time, 2) using low-quality proxies, or 3) not covering the web scraper’s fingerprint properly.[33]\\nCommercial anti-bot services: Companies offer anti-bot and anti-scraping services for websites. A few web application firewalls have limited bot detection capabilities as well. However, many such solutions are not very effective.[34]\\nLocating bots with a honeypot or other method to identify the IP addresses of automated crawlers.\\nObfuscation using CSS sprites to display such data as telephone numbers or email addresses, at the cost of accessibility to screen reader users.\\nBecause bots rely on consistency in the front-end code of a target website, adding small variations to the HTML/CSS surrounding important data and navigation elements would require more human involvement in the initial set up of a bot and if done effectively may render the target website too difficult to scrape due to the diminished ability to automate the scraping process.[35]\\nWebsites can declare if crawling is allowed or not in the robots.txt file and allow partial access, limit the crawl rate, specify the optimal time to crawl and more.\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\nInternet portal\\n\\nArchive.today\\nComparison of feed aggregators\\nData scraping\\nData wrangling\\nImporter\\nJob wrapping\\nKnowledge extraction\\nOpenSocial\\nScraper site\\nFake news website\\nSpamdexing\\nDomain name drop list\\nText corpus\\nWeb archiving\\nWeb crawler\\nOffline reader\\nLink farm (blog network)\\nSearch engine scraping\\nWeb crawlers\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ Thapelo, Tsaone Swaabow; Namoshe, Molaletsa; Matsebe, Oduetse; Motshegwa, Tshiamo; Bopape, Mary-Jane Morongwa (2021-07-28). \"SASSCAL WebSAPI: A Web Scraping Application Programming Interface to Support Access to SASSCAL\\'s Weather Data\".

      "A hamburger, often known as a burger, consists of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun, sesame seed bun, or bread roll. The patties are often served with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis. The filling of the burger can be topped with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish or a \"special sauce\", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing. A burger with the patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.[1] Under some definitions, a hamburger is considered a sandwich.\n",
      "Hamburgers are typically associated with fast-food restaurants and diners but are also sold at other restaurants, including high-end establishments. There are many international and regional variations of hamburgers. Some of the largest multinational fast-food chains feature burgers as one of their core products: McDonald's Big Mac and Burger King's Whopper have become global icons of American culture.[2][3]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Etymology and terminology\n",
      "The term hamburger originally derives from Hamburg, Germany. However, it is contentious what the exact connection between the food item and the city is.[4][5][6]\n",
      "By linguistic rebracketing, the term \"burger\" eventually became a self-standing word that is associated with many different types of sandwiches that are similar to a hamburger, but contain different meats such as buffalo in the buffalo burger, venison, kangaroo, chicken,[7][8][9] turkey, elk, lamb or fish such as salmon in the salmon burger, and even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger.[10]\n",
      "The term burger can also be applied to a meat patty on its own. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, or portobello burger.\n",
      "\n",
      "History\n",
      "Main articles: History of the hamburger and History of the hamburger in the United States\n",
      "Hamburg steak has been known as \"Frikadelle\" in Germany since the 17th century.\n",
      "The \"Hamburger Rundstück\" was popular already in 1869 and is believed to be a precursor to the modern Hamburger.\n",
      "Cheeseburger (with onions and tomatoes) at Louis' Lunch, New Haven, Connecticut\n",
      "Versions of the meal have been served for over a century, but its origins are still unclear.[11] The 1758 edition of the book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse included a recipe called \"Hamburgh sausage\", suggesting that it should be served \"roasted with toasted bread under it.\" A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg under the name of \"Rundstück warm\" (\"bread roll warm\") in 1869 or earlier,[12] and was supposedly eaten by emigrants on their way to America. However, this may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than Frikadelle. It has alternatively been suggested that Hamburg steak served between two pieces of bread and eaten by Jewish passengers travelling from Hamburg to New York on Hamburg America Line vessels (which began operations in 1847) became so well known that the shipping company gave its name to the dish.[13] It is not known which of these stories is the reason hamburgers got their name.\n",
      "There is a reference to a \"Hamburg steak\" as early as 1884 in The Boston Journal.[OED, under \"steak\"] On July 5, 1896, the Chicago Daily Tribune made a highly specific claim regarding a \"hamburger sandwich\" in an article about a \"Sandwich Car\": \"A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range.\"[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Claims of invention\n",
      "\"Hamburger steak sandwiches\" have been advertised in U.S. newspapers from New York to Hawaii since at least the 1890s, but the inventor is unclear.[15]\n",
      "The invention of hamburgers is attributed to various people, including Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, Fletcher Davis, and Louis Lassen.[16][17] White Castle traces the origin of the hamburger to Otto Krause in Hamburg, Germany.[18] Some have pointed to a recipe for \"Hamburgh sausages\" on toasted bread, published in The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse in 1758, as a notable first source of the dish.[15]\n",
      "Hamburgers gained national recognition in the U.S. at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when the New York Tribune referred to the hamburger as \"the innovation of a food vendor on the pike.\"[17] No conclusive argument has ended the dispute over invention. An article from ABC News sums up: \"One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the burger spread happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went instantly. And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country.\"[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "Louis Lassen\n",
      "The restaurant Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut, founded in 1895, has long claimed to be the \"birthplace of the hamburger sandwich\".[20] Ostensibly, around 1900, Danish immigrant Louis Lassen found himself out of steaks when a customer ordered a quick hot meal. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty and grilled it, putting it between two slices of toast.[17] (Some critics, such as New York Magazine food editor Joshua Ozersky, claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted.[21]) New York Magazine wrote in 1977 that, supposedly, \"The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later\".[22] This origin story has been amplified by Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro and the Library of Congress[23][24]—notwithstanding earlier references to hamburgers elsewhere in the country.[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie Nagreen\n",
      "One of the earliest claims of hamburger invention comes from Charlie Nagreen, who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair[25] now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair.[21] The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, also referred to as \"Hamburger Charlie\", with the invention. Nagreen was 15 when he reportedly sold pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.[26][27]\n",
      "\n",
      "Otto Krause\n",
      "According to White Castle, Otto Krause was the inventor of the hamburger. In 1891, he created a beef patty cooked in butter and topped with a fried egg. German sailors later omitted the fried egg.[17]\n",
      "\n",
      "Oscar Weber Bilby\n",
      "The family of Oscar Weber Bilby claims the first-known hamburger on a bun was served on July 4, 1891, on Grandpa Oscar's farm. The bun was a yeast bun.[28][29][30] In 1995, Governor Frank Keating proclaimed that the first true hamburger on a bun was created and consumed in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1891, calling Tulsa, \"The Real Birthplace of the Hamburger\".[31]\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank and Charles Menches\n",
      "A bacon cheeseburger from a New York City diner\n",
      "Frank and Charles Menches claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in 1885 in Hamburg, New York.[21] During the fair, they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef. The brothers exhausted their supply of sausage, so they purchased chopped-up beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein. Historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein's market, not Klein's, despite Stein's having sold the market in 1874. The story notes that, in this case, the name of the hamburger comes from Hamburg, New York, not Hamburg, Germany.[25] Frank Menches's obituary in The New York Times states that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in Akron, Ohio.[32]\n",
      "\n",
      "Fletcher Davis\n",
      "Fletcher Davis of Athens, Texas, claimed to have invented the hamburger. According to oral histories, he opened a lunch counter in Athens in the 1880s and served a 'burger' of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread, with a pickle on the side. The story is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World's Fair.[17] Historian Frank X. Tolbert noted that Athens resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with Fletcher \"Old Dave\" Davis. A photo of \"Old Dave's Hamburger Stand\" from 1904 was sent to Tolbert as evidence of the claim.[25]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other hamburger-steak claims\n",
      "Various claims of the invention relate to the term \"hamburger steak\" without mention of its being a sandwich. The alleged first printed American menu listing hamburgers is an 1834 menu from Delmonico's in New York.[33] However, the printer of the original menu was not yet in business in 1834.[30] In 1889, a menu from Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item.[17]\n",
      "Between 1871 and 1884, \"Hamburg Beefsteak\" was on the \"Breakfast and Supper Menu\" of the Clipper Restaurant at 311/313 Pacific Street in San Fernando, California. It cost 10 cents—the same price as mutton chops, pig's feet in batter, and stewed veal. It was not, however, on the dinner menu. Only \"Pig's Head\", \"Calf Tongue\", and \"Stewed Kidneys\" were listed.[34] Another claim ties the hamburger to Summit County, in New York or Ohio. Summit County, Ohio, exists, but Summit County, New York, does not.[25]\n",

      "McDonald's Big Mac\n",
      "1921: White Castle, Wichita, Kansas. Due to books by Upton Sinclair and Arthur Kallet discrediting the cleanliness and nutritional value of ground beef, hamburger meat was unpopular with families until the White Castle restaurant chain took it upon themselves to market the cleanliness and quality of their food through scientific studies by preparing the food in full view of customers. The Company also reported in local newspapers how they carefully selected their meat, and opened the \"Food Experiment Department\" as a test kitchen and quality-control laboratory.[35] White Castle marketed and sold large numbers of small 65 mm (2+1⁄2 in) square hamburger sandwiches, known as sliders, and created five holes in each patty, which helped them cook evenly and eliminated the need to flip the burger. In 1995, White Castle began selling frozen hamburgers in convenience stores and vending machines.[36]\n",
      "1923: Kewpee Hamburgers, or Kewpee Hotels, Flint, Michigan. Kewpee was the second established hamburger chain and peaked at 400 locations before World War II. Many of these locations were licensed but not strictly franchised, and many closed during WWII. Between 1955 and 1967, another wave of Kewpee Hamburgers restaurants closed or changed names. In 1967, the Kewpee licensor moved the company to a franchise system. As of 2025, there are only five locations remaining.\n",
      "1926: White Tower Hamburgers\n",
      "1927: Little Tavern\n",
      "1932: Krystal[35]\n",
      "1936: Big Boy. In 1937, Bob Wian created the double-decker hamburger at his stand in Glendale, California. Big Boy became the name of the hamburger, mascot, and restaurant. Big Boy expanded nationally through regional franchising and subfranchising. Primarily operating as drive-in restaurants in the 1950s, interior dining gradually replaced curb service by the early 1970s. Many franchises have closed or switched to operated independently, but the Big Boy double-decker hamburger remains the signature item at the remaining American Big Boy restaurants.\n",
      "1940: McDonald's restaurant, San Bernardino, California, was opened by Richard and Maurice McDonald. Their introduction of the \"Speedee Service System\" in 1948 established the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant. The McDonald brothers began franchising in 1953. In 1961, Ray Kroc (the supplier of their multi-mixer milkshake machines) purchased the company from the brothers for $2.7 million and a 1.9% royalty.[37]\n",
      "In the United States\n",
      "Hamburger preparation in a fast food establishment A hamburger with fries bought as take-away, with the hamburger and the fries in separate containers\n",
      "Hamburgers are often a feature of fast food restaurants. In the United States, the hamburger patties served by major fast food chains are usually mass-produced in factories and then frozen for delivery to the site.[38] These hamburgers are relatively thin, differing from the traditional American hamburger prepared in homes and conventional restaurants, which is thicker and prepared by hand from ground beef. Most American hamburgers are round, but some fast-food chains, such as Wendy's, Krystal, and White Castle sell square-cut hamburgers. Hamburgers in fast food restaurants are usually grilled on a flat top, but some establishments, such as Burger King, use a gas flame grilling process. At conventional American restaurants, hamburgers may be ordered \"rare\" but normally are served medium-well or well-done for food safety reasons. Fast food restaurants do not usually offer this option.\n",
      "The McDonald's fast-food chain sells the Big Mac, one of the world's top-selling hamburgers, with an estimated 550 million sold annually in the United States.[39] Many other major fast-food chains, also rely heavily on hamburger sales, including Burger King (known as Hungry Jack's in Australia), A&W, Culver's, Whataburger, Carl's Jr./Hardee's chain, Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Krystal, White Castle, Cook Out, Harvey's, Hesburger, Supermac's, Shake Shack, In-N-Out Burger, Five Guys, Fatburger, Vera's, Burgerville, Back Yard Burgers, Lick's Homeburger, Roy Rogers, Smashburger, and Sonic. Fuddruckers and Red Robin are hamburger chains that specialize in the mid-tier \"restaurant-style\" variety of hamburgers.\n",
      "Some restaurants offer elaborate hamburgers using expensive cuts of meat and various cheeses, toppings, and sauces. One example is the Bobby's Burger Palace chain founded by celebrity chef and Food Network star Bobby Flay.\n",
      "Hamburgers are often served as a fast dinner, picnic, or party food and are often cooked outdoors on barbecue grills.\n",
      "A high-quality hamburger patty is made entirely of ground (minced) beef and seasonings. These may be described as \"all-beef hamburger\" or \"all-beef patties\" to distinguish them from inexpensive hamburgers made with cost-savers like added flour, textured vegetable protein, ammonia treated defatted beef trimmings,[40][41] advanced meat recovery, or other fillers. In the 1930s, ground liver was sometimes added. Some cooks prepare their patties with binders like eggs or breadcrumbs. Seasonings may include salt and pepper, parsley, onions, soy sauce, Thousand Island dressing, onion soup mix, or Worcestershire sauce. Many name-brand seasoned salt products are also used.\n",

      "Cost\n",
      "According to Bloomberg News, the average price of a fast-food restaurant burger in the United States increased by 16% between 2019 and 2024, reaching $8.41 in the second quarter of 2024. Specifically, the iconic Big Mac at McDonald's cost $5.29 during the same period, representing a 21% price increase over the same five-year span.[42]\n",
      "The cost of Big Mac hamburgers in different countries has been used by The Economist to easily compare purchasing power of different currencies in the Big Mac Index.[43]\n",

      "Safety\n",
      "Raw hamburgers may contain harmful bacteria that can produce food-borne illnesses such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, due to the occasional initial improper preparation of the meat, so caution is required for safety during handling and cooking. Because of the potential for food-borne illness, the USDA, recommends hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 °F (71 °C).[44] If cooked to this temperature, they are considered well-done.[45]\n",

      "In the United States, \"steak burger\" is a marketing term for a hamburger claimed to be of superior quality.[68][69][70] In Australia, the term refers to a burger bun containing a steak and is more commonly called a steak sandwich.[71][72][73][74]\n",
      "Use of the term \"steakburger\" dates to the 1920s in the United States.[75] In the U.S. in 1934, A.H. \"Gus\" Belt, the founder of Steak 'n Shake, devised a higher-quality hamburger and offered it as a \"steakburger\" to customers at the company's first location in Normal, Illinois. This burger used a combination of ground meat from the strip portion of T-bone steak and sirloin steak in its preparation. Steakburgers are a primary menu item at Steak 'n Shake restaurants,[76] and the company's registered trademarks included \"original steakburger\" and \"famous for steakburgers\".[77] Steak 'n Shake's \"Prime Steakburgers\" are now made of choice grade brisket and chuck.[78]\n",
      "In 2004, Steak 'n Shake sued Burger King over the latter's use of the term Steak Burger in conjunction with one of its menu items, claiming that such use infringed on trademark rights.[79][80]\n",
      "The case was settled out of court.[81]\n",
      "\n",
      "France\n",
      "In 2012, according to a study by the NDP cabinet, the French consume 14 hamburgers in restaurants per year per person, placing them fourth in the world and second in Europe, just behind the British.[82] A popular burger chain in France is Quick.[83]\n",
      "According to a study by Gira Conseil on the consumption of hamburgers in France in 2013, 75% of traditional French restaurants offer at least one hamburger on their menu, and for a third of these restaurants, it has become the leader in the range of dishes, ahead of rib steaks, grills, or fish.[84]\n",
      "\n",
      "Mexico\n",
      "In Mexico, burgers (called hamburguesas) are served with ham[85] and slices of American cheese fried on top of the meat patty. The toppings include avocado, jalapeño slices, shredded lettuce, onion, and tomato. The bun has mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard. Bacon may also be added, which can be fried or grilled along with the meat patty. A slice of pineapple may be added to a hamburger for a \"Hawaiian hamburger\".[citation needed]\n",
      "Some restaurants' burgers also have barbecue sauce, and others replace the ground patty with sirloin, Al pastor meat, barbacoa, or fried chicken breast. Many burger chains from the United States can be found in Mexico, including Carl's Jr., Sonic, McDonald's, and Burger King.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "United Kingdom and Ireland\n",
      "Hamburgers in the UK and Ireland are very similar to those in the US, and the same big two chains dominate there as in the U.S. — McDonald's and Burger King. The menus offered to both countries are virtually identical, although portion sizes tend to be smaller in the UK. In Ireland, the burger-serving food outlet Supermacs is widespread throughout the country. In Ireland, Abrakebabra, which began as a kebab restaurant, and Eddie Rocket's are also major chains.[citation needed]\n",
      "A native rival to the big two U.S. chains was the fast-food chain popular in Britain, Wimpy, originally known as Wimpy Bar (opened 1954 at the Lyon's Corner House in Coventry Street London), which served its hamburgers on a plate with British-style chips, accompanied by cutlery and delivered to the customer's table. In the late 1970s, to compete with McDonald's,[86] Wimpy began to open American-style counter-service restaurants, and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re-branded as Burger Kings between 1989 and 1990 by the then-owner of both brands, Grand Metropolitan. A management buyout in 1990 split the brands again, and now Wimpy table-service restaurants can still be found in many town centers, while new counter-service Wimpys are now often found at highway service stations.[citation needed]\n",
      "Hamburgers are also available from mobile kiosks, commonly known as \"burger vans\", particularly at outdoor events such as soccer games. These burgers are usually served without any form of salad, only fried onions and a choice of tomato ketchup, mustard, or brown sauce.[citation needed]\n",
      "Hamburgers and veggie burgers served with chips, and salad are standard pub grub menu items. Many pubs specialize in \"gourmet\" burgers. These are usually high-quality minced steak patties topped with things such as blue cheese, brie, avocado, or anchovy mayonnaise.. Some British pubs serve burger patties made from more exotic meats, including venison burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), bison burgers, ostrich burgers, and in some Australian-themed pubs even kangaroo burgers can be purchased. These burgers are served similarly to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce, including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce, or plum sauce.[citation needed]\n",
      "In the early 21st century, \"premium\" hamburger chains and independent restaurants have arisen, selling burgers produced from meat stated to be of high quality and often organic, usually served to eat on the premises rather than to take to-go.[87] Chains include Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Ultimate Burger, Hamburger Union, and Byron Hamburgers in London. Independent restaurants such as Meatmarket and Dirty Burger developed a style of rich, juicy burger in 2012 which is known as a dirty burger or third-wave burger.[88]\n",
      "In the UK, as in North America and Japan, the term \"burger\" can refer simply to the patty, be it beef, some other kind of meat, or vegetarian.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "Australia and New Zealand\n",
      "This hamburger in a fast food restaurant in Auckland, New Zealand, contains beetroot for flavor.\n",
      "Fast food franchises sell American-style fast-food hamburgers in Australia and New Zealand. The traditional Australasian hamburgers are usually bought from fish and chip shops or milk bars rather than from chain restaurants. These traditional hamburgers are becoming less common as older-style fast food outlets decrease in number. The hamburger meat is almost always ground beef, or \"mince\", as it is more commonly referred to in Australia and New Zealand. They often include tomato, lettuce, grilled onion, and meat, at least. This is known in Australia as a \"plain hamburger\", and may also include cheese, pineapple, a fried egg, beetroot, and bacon. If all these optional ingredients are included, it is known in Australia as a \"burger with the lot\".[89][90]\n",
      "In Australia and New Zealand, as in the United Kingdom, the word sandwich is generally reserved for two slices of bread (from a loaf) with fillings in between them. This is unlike in American English where a sandwich is fillings between two pieces of any kind of bread, not only slices of bread. As such, in Australia and New Zealand, burgers are not generally considered to be sandwiches.[91] The term burger is applied to any cut bun with a hot filling, even when the filling does not contain beef, such as a chicken burger (generally with chicken breast rather than chicken mince), salmon burger, pulled pork burger, veggie burger, etc.[citation needed]\n",
      "The only variance between the two countries' hamburgers is that New Zealand's equivalent to \"The Lot\" often contains a steak (beef). The condiments regularly used are barbecue sauce and tomato sauce. The traditional Australasian hamburger never includes mayonnaise. The McDonald's \"McOz\" Burger is partway between American and Australian style burgers, having beetroot and tomato in an otherwise typical American burger; however, it is no longer a part of the menu. Likewise, McDonald's in New Zealand created a Kiwiburger, similar to a Quarter Pounder, but including salad, beetroot, and a fried egg. The Hungry Jack's (Burger King) \"Aussie Burger\" has tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese, bacon, beetroot, egg, ketchup, and a meat patty, while adding pineapple is an upcharge. It is essentially a \"Burger with the lot\" but uses the standard Hungery Jack's circular breakfast egg rather than the fully fried egg used by local fish shops.[92]\n",
      "\n",
      "China\n",
      "Roujiamo, the \"Chinese hamburger\"\n",
      "In China, due to the branding of their sandwiches by McDonald's and KFC restaurants in China, the word \"burger\" (汉堡) refers to all sandwiches that consist of two pieces of bun and a meat patty in between.[93]\n",
      "A popular Chinese street food, known as roujiamo (肉夹馍), consists of meat (most commonly pork) sandwiched between two buns. Roujiamo has been called the \"Chinese hamburger\".[94] Since the sandwich dates back to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and fits the aforementioned Chinese word for burger, Chinese media have claimed that the hamburger was invented in China.[95][96][93]\n",
      "\n",
      "Japan\n",
      "MOS Burger rice burger\n",
      "In Japan, hamburgers can be served in a bun, called hanbāgā (ハンバーガー), or without a bun, which is known as hanbāgu (ハンバーグ) or \"hamburg\", short for \"hamburg steak\".\n",
      "Hamburg steaks (served without buns) are similar to what are known as Salisbury steaks in the US. They are made from minced beef, pork, or a blend of the two mixed with minced onions, eggs, breadcrumbs, and spices. They are served with brown sauce (or demi-glace in restaurants) with vegetable or salad sides, or occasionally in Japanese curries. Hamburgers may be served in casual, Western-style suburban restaurant chains known in Japan as \"family restaurants\".[citation needed]\n",
      "Hamburgers with buns are predominantly the domain of fast food chains. Japan has homegrown hamburger chain restaurants such as MOS Burger, First Kitchen, and Freshness Burger. Local varieties of burgers served in Japan include teriyaki burgers, katsu burgers (containing tonkatsu) and burgers containing shrimp korokke. Some of the more unusual examples include the rice burger, where the bun is made of rice, and the luxury 1,000-yen (US$10) \"Takumi Burger\" (meaning \"artisan taste\"), featuring avocados, freshly grated wasabi, and other rare seasonal ingredients. In terms of the actual patty, there are burgers made with Kobe beef, butchered from cows that are fed with beer and massaged daily. McDonald's Japan also recently in 2021[97] launched a McPork burger made with US pork. McDonald's has been gradually losing market share in Japan to these local hamburger chains due partly to the preference of Japanese diners for fresh ingredients and more refined, \"upscale\" hamburger offerings.[98]\n",
      "\n",
      "Denmark\n",
      "The modern Danish bøfsandwich\n",
      "In Denmark, the hamburger was introduced in 1949, though it was called the bøfsandwich. There are many variations. While the original bøfsandwich was simply a generic meat patty containing a mix of beef and horse meat, with slightly different garnish (mustard, ketchup, and soft onions), it has continued to evolve. Today, a bøfsandwich usually contains a beef patty; pickled cucumber; raw, pickled, fried, or soft onions; pickled red beets; mustard; ketchup; remoulade; and is often overflowing with brown gravy, which is sometimes even poured on top of the assembled bøfsandwich. The original bøfsandwich is still on the menu at the same restaurant from which it originated in 1949, now run by the original owner's grandson.[99]\n",
      "Following the popularity of the bøfsandwich, many variations sprung up, using different types of meat instead of the beef patty. One variation, the flæskestegssandwich, grew especially popular. This variation replaces the minced beef patty with slices of pork loin or belly and typically uses sweet-and-sour pickled red cabbage, mayonnaise, mustard, and pork rinds as garnish.[100]\n",
      "Today, the bøfsandwich, flæskestegssandwich, and their many variations co-exist with the more typical hamburger, with the opening of the first Burger King restaurant in 1977 popularizing the United States dish in Denmark. Many local, high-end burger restaurants dot the major cities, including Popl, an offshoot of Noma.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "East Asia\n",
      "Korean-style bulgogi burger\n",
      "Rice burgers mentioned above are also available in several East Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. Lotteria is a prominent hamburger franchise in Japan owned by the South Korean Lotte group, with outlets also in China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. In addition to selling beef hamburgers, they have hamburgers made from squid, pork, tofu, and shrimp. Variations available in South Korea include Bulgogi burgers and Kimchi burgers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chicken burger with rice bun (sold in Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macao, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore). Note that the \"bun\" is composed of cooked rice.\n",
      "In the Philippines, a wide range of major U.S. fast-food franchises are well represented, together with local imitators, often amended to the local palate. The chain McDonald's (locally nicknamed \"McDo\") has a range of burger and chicken dishes often accompanied by plain steamed rice, or French fries. The Philippines boasts its own burger chain called Jollibee, which offers burger meals and chicken, including a signature burger called \"Champ\". Jollibee now has several outlets in the United States, the SWANA region, and East Asia.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "India\n",
      "Vada pav or \"Bombay Burger\" is made of potatoes and spices.\n",
      "In India, where there are cultural beliefs against eating beef (which stem from Hindu religious practice) and pork (which stems from Islamic religious practice), the term burger refers to a variety of sandwiches usually made from chicken or vegetable patties. Accordingly, most fast food chains and restaurants in India do not serve beef. McDonald's in India offers the \"Maharaja Mac\" instead of the Big Mac, substituting the beef patties with chicken.[101]\n",
      "The vada pav, consisting of a deep-fried potato patty dipped in gram flour batter, is sometimes called the Bombay burger.[102]\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan\n",
      "In Pakistan, apart from in American fast food chains, burgers can be found in stalls near shopping areas. The best known is the \"shami burger\". This is made from \"shami kebab\", made by mixing lentils and minced lamb.[103] Onions, scrambled eggs, and ketchup are the most popular toppings.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaysia\n",
      "Fast-food burger restaurants in Malaysia typically sell eggs and fried chicken in addition to U.S.-style burgers. A popular local brand is Ramly Burger, which combines a standard hamburger with an omelette.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "Mongolia\n",
      "In Mongolia, a recent surge in popularity of fast food due to the sudden influx of foreign influence has led to increasing prominence of the hamburger. Specialized fast food restaurants serving to Mongolian tastes have sprung up and seen great success.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "Beef burger with fried egg, cabbage and some french fries in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia\n",
      "Turkey\n",
      "In Turkey, in addition to the internationally familiar offerings, numerous localized variants of the hamburger may be found, such as the Islak Burger (lit. 'Wet-Burger'), which is a beef slider doused in seasoned tomato sauce and steamed inside a special glass chamber, and has its origins in the Turkish fast food retailer Kizilkayalar. Other variations include lamb burgers and offal-burgers, which are offered by local fast food businesses and global chains alike, such as McDonald's and Burger King. Almost all major fast food chains deliver.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "Yugoslavia and Serbia\n",
      "In the former Yugoslavia, and originally in Serbia, there is a local version of the hamburger known as the pljeskavica. It is often served as a patty but may also have a bun.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "Belgium and Netherlands\n",
      "Throughout Belgium and in some eateries in the Netherlands, a Bicky Burger is sold that combines pork, chicken, and horse meat.[104][105] The hamburger, usually fried, is served between a bun, sprinkled with sesame seeds. It often comes with a specific Bickysaus (Bicky dressing) made with mayonnaise, mustard, cabbage, and onion.[104]\n",

      "Unusual hamburgers\n",
      "In May 2012, Serendipity 3 was recognized as the Guinness World Records holder for serving the world's most expensive hamburger, the $295 Le Burger Extravagant.[106]\n",
      "At $499, the world's largest hamburger commercially available weighs 185.8 pounds (84.3 kg) and is sold at Mallie's Sports Grill & Bar in Southgate, Michigan. Called the \"Absolutely Ridiculous Burger\", it takes about 12 hours to prepare. It was cooked and adjudicated on May 30, 2009.[107]\n",
      "A $777 Kobe beef and Maine lobster burger, topped with caramelized onion, Brie cheese, and prosciutto, was reported available at Le Burger Brasserie, inside the Paris Las Vegas casino.[108]\n",
      "On August 5, 2013, the first hamburger grown with cow cells outside a living animal was served. It was the result of a $300,000 research project into cultured meat, led by Mark Post at Maastricht University and sponsored by Google's co-founder Sergey Brin.[109]\n",
      "Slang\n",
      "\"$100 hamburger\" (\"hundred-dollar hamburger\") is aviation slang for a general aviation pilot needing an excuse to fly. A $100 hamburger trip typically involves flying a short distance (less than two hours), eating at an airport restaurant, and flying home.[110]\n",
